# Black-Jack
As a player, your goal is to get as close to or exactly 21 without going over. 
The most versatile card is the Ace card as it can worth 11 if it is hit in the first turn, and it can worth 1 from the second turn. 
The Jack, Queen, and King card all worth only 10 points. 
The rest of the cards equal the value of the card.

When you start the game, the dealer will hand you two random cards. At this point, you must determine the sum of your current cards and see if you would like to add more to that value or none. 
Then the dealer will ask you to “Hit” or “Stand”. When you click “Hit”, you will receive another random card. You can hit as many times as you want, however, if you go over 21, you will get “busted” and lose.

The dealer also has the option to “Hit” or “Stand”. However, the dealer must continue to “hit” until he reaches 17 or more. At this point, he may chose to “Stand”. 

Once you and the dealer has chosen to “Stand”, the sum of your cards will be compared.
If your total is less than or equal 21 but greater than the dealer, then you win! 
If your total is less than or equal to 21 but also less than the dealer, then you are busted.
The perfect hand combines an the Ace with a 10, Jack, Queen or King and is known as a "Blackjack".
